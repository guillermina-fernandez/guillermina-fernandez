# Hi there, I'm Guillermina Fernandez! ðŸ‘‹

I am a fast learner, independent developer with a passion for problem-solving and making processes more efficient. I am adaptable to new tasks and obligations and always eager to learn and grow.

## What I've Been Working On ðŸŒ±

I have developed various solutions with Python and Django, implementing databases with MySQL and SQLite, and streamlining processes with Javascript. I'm currently working with DRF and React.

For the projects I have worked on, I assessed the business models and requirements to define the system architecture, the database structure, and the user experience design, ensuring alignment with operational goals.

I love coding and I am passionate about being able to improve work efficiency by developing new solutions that automate tasks and reduce errors. Every project must be approached with suitable technology, so learning new skills is a must.
