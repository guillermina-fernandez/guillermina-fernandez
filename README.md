Hi there, I'm Guillermina Fernandez! 👋
I'm a fast learner, self-trained, independent developer with a passion for problem-solving and making processes more efficient. I'm adaptable to new tasks and obligations and always eager to learn and grow.

What I'm Interested In 🔍
My main goal is to become a skilled developer. I enjoy working with new technologies and tools, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

What I'm Currently Working On 🌱
I'm currently working with Python and Django, implementing databases with MySQL and SQL, and streamlining various processes with Javascript. I have developed an accounting software and a web application for shipping agencies' operations.

I have studied the business model and its requirements, laid out the models and relations, designed the UIs, and managed all database queries and controllers. I love coding and I'am passionate about being able to improve work efficiency by developing new solutions that automate tasks and reduce errors. Every project must be approached with suitable technology, so learning new skills is a must. 💻
